## About Me

Hi. I'm Hankun Dai, a second-year master student at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

I'm now building an AI-powered system to find faster algorithms, like DeepMind's [AlphaTensor](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/discovering-novel-algorithms-with-alphatensor/). If you are interested and would like to talk, please feel free to drop me an email.

## Research Interests

I'm interested in building complex <font color="navy">**computer systems**</font> and studying how they can be combined with <font color="navy">**machine learning**</font>.

## Projects

Selected computer systems I've built:

- Operating system running on dual core RISC-V RocketChip [Git repo](https://github.com/D-Hank/UCAS-OSLAB)
- Tiny C compiler based on ANTLR [Git repo](https://github.com/D-Hank/UCAS-Compiler)
- Memory database query engine [Git repo](https://github.com/D-Hank/UCAS-Database-System)
- Pipelined CPU able to boot Linux on FPGA [Git repo](https://github.com/D-Hank/UCAS-Computer-Architecture)

I also reimplemented some AI-related work, including:

[TVCG PRS-Net](https://github.com/D-Hank/PRS-Net) (with some improvement), [ECCV NeRF](https://github.com/D-Hank/NeRF-tiny)

## Thesis

Optimization and Acceleration of Atmospheric Model FV3 on AMD GPUs

## Awards

- Outstanding Student of 2020 ~ 2021, UCAS
- Academic Scholarship of 2020 ~ 2021, UCAS

## Beyond Academia

Love to try different things. Now focus on travelling, photography and rock & roll.
