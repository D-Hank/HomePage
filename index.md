## About Me

Hi. I'm Hankun Dai (or you can simply call me Hank), a second-year master student at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

I'm now building an AI-powered system to find faster distributed algorithms, inspired by DeepMind's [AlphaTensor](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/discovering-novel-algorithms-with-alphatensor/). If you are interested and would like to talk, please feel free to drop me an email.

## Research Interests

I'm interested in building complex <font color="navy"><b>computer systems</b></font> and studying how they can be combined with <font color="navy"><b>machine learning</b></font> (systems to boost ML and ML algorithms to design better systems).

## Projects

Selected computer systems I've built:

- Operating system running on dual core RISC-V RocketChip [[Git repo](https://github.com/D-Hank/UCAS-OSLAB)]
- Tiny C compiler based on ANTLR [[Git repo](https://github.com/D-Hank/UCAS-Compiler)]
- Memory database query engine [[Git repo](https://github.com/D-Hank/UCAS-Database-System)]
- Pipelined CPU able to boot Linux on FPGA [[Git repo](https://github.com/D-Hank/UCAS-Computer-Architecture)]

I also reimplemented some AI-related work, including:

&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;[TVCG PRS-Net](https://github.com/D-Hank/PRS-Net) (with some improvement), [ECCV NeRF](https://github.com/D-Hank/NeRF-tiny)

## Thesis

Porting and optimization of an atmospheric model core FV3 on GPU heterogeneous systems

## Awards

- Outstanding Student of 2020 ~ 2021, UCAS
- Academic Scholarship of 2020 ~ 2021, UCAS

## Contact

The first choice is email. Other ways should be ok. For some reasons, I contribute to [gitee](https://gitee.com/dhank) more often than my github.

## Leisure Life

Love to try different things. Now focus on:

- Travelling
- Photography
- Rock & Roll
